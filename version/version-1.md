# Version 1: Basic Geolocation

## 1. Define the Scope and Requirements for Version 1

- Features:
  Get the user's current location.
  Handle user permissions.
  Provide basic error handling.
- Dependencies: None for version 1 (use the native Geolocation API).

## 2. Set Up the Project

- Project Initialization:
  Create a new project directory.
  Initialize the project with npm or yarn:

  ```sh
  npm init -y
  ```

- TypeScript Setup (if using):

- Install TypeScript and create a tsconfig.json:

```sh
npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc --init
```

## 3. Handle User Location

- Geolocation API:
  Use the `navigator.geolocation` object to access the Geolocation API.
  Implement methods to get the current position:
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorCallback, options)
- Permissions:
  Inform the user about the need for location permissions.
  Handle scenarios where the user denies permission.

## 4. Error Handling

- Common Errors:
  Implement error handling for common geolocation errors:
  User denies permission.
  Position unavailable.
  Request timeout.
- Error Messages:
  Provide clear and descriptive error messages.

## 5. API Design

- Function Structure:
  Design simple, clear functions for getting the current location.
  Example functions:
  getCurrentLocation(): Returns a promise that resolves with the user's current coordinates.
- Promises and Callbacks:
  Implement the library using promises for asynchronous operations.

## 6. Testing

- Unit Tests:
  Write unit tests for the main functions.
  Use a testing framework like Jest.
- Mocking Geolocation:
  Mock the Geolocation API for testing purposes.

## 7. Documentation

- Basic Documentation:
  Create a README file with an overview of the library, installation instructions, and basic usage examples.
- API Documentation:
  Document the main functions and their parameters.

## 8. Distribution

- Bundling:
  Use a bundler like Webpack to bundle the library for distribution.
  Create both development and production builds.
- Package Publishing:
  Publish the library to npm:

```sh
npm publish
```

## Version 1 Implementation Steps

- Project Initialization
  Set up your project directory.
  Initialize with npm and configure TypeScript.

- Implement Geolocation Functionality
  Create the geolocation.ts file in the src directory.
  Implement functions to get the user's current location.

- Handle Permissions and Errors
  Ensure proper handling of user permissions and common errors.

- Write Unit Tests
  Create the geolocation.test.ts file in the tests directory.
  Write tests for the geolocation functions using Jest or another testing framework.

- Bundle the Library
  Configure Webpack for bundling.
  Create development and production builds.

- Document the Library
  Write a README with installation and usage instructions.
  Document the API functions.

- Publish the Library
  Publish the library to npm for easy installation and usage by others.
